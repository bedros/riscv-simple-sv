# riscv-simple-sv

This is a simple RISC V (rv32i) core for teaching purposes. It is written in a subset of SystemVerilog understood by Yosys, the open-source hardware synthesis framework. The implementation is extremely simple, no bells and whistles, and it's modularized sensibly, so that schematics generated by synthesis tools are readable.

The code is adapted from [riscv-simple](https://github.com/arthurbeggs/riscv-simple). Code structure has benn modified for readability, and several bugs have been fixed.

## Testing 

The core is tested using [official unit tests](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests).
